# Automated Feature Reporting

At almost every place I've worked I've had to write one of these feature analysis tools from scratch most of the time.
It would be nice to just "have" something available for use whenever and wherever.
There are some tools already out there, but I'm not crazy about any of them.

# Setup for development:

- Setup a python >= 3.8 venv (usually in `.venv`)
  - You can run `./scripts/create-venv.sh` to generate one
- `pip3 install --upgrade pip`
- Install pip-tools `pip3 install pip-tools`
- Update dev requirements: `pip-compile --output-file=requirements.dev.txt requirements.dev.in`
- Update requirements: `pip-compile --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in`
- Install dev requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.dev.txt`
- Install requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- `pre-commit install`

## Update versions

`pip-compile --output-file=requirements.dev.txt requirements.dev.in --upgrade`
`pip-compile --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in --upgrade`

# Run `pre-commit` locally.

`pre-commit run --all-files`
